         		<h1>// Is there one way that your ability to achieve a goal and/or happiness been affected by the way the way people perceive/treat you because of your gender identity? 
				If so, please describe it. If not, say why.:</h1>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I've been socially trained to achieve my goals by playing into gender stereotypes.  
				I feel too insecure to directly ask for what I want.  
				Instead, I choose to play coy, to make people feel that what I want is what they want, 
				to smile, touch a shoulder, and speak in tones much higher than my actual speaking voice. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I was addicted to rom-coms growing up, and even when I became cognizant of my source of motivation for everything, 
				I still relied on my desire to be the coolest girl-next-door. 
				It's weird to focus on looking apparently feminine but strong. 
				I think a main driving force for me wanting to be an artist was that art would make me endearingly quirky but impressive. 
				Now that I am an artist, I feel I've achieved becoming one, but now I'm not sure what I have to say, why I'm here.  </p>
			<p> <b> male cisgender: </b> uh i dont really agree with my passing as a cis dude, 
				so in terms of my affect (not my ability to achieve goals, which is kinda helped by passing as a cis dude, 
				(tho impeded by being a poc) people just used they/them pronouns to start with and left it at that unless someone disagreed with neutral gendering. 
				also @yts the hypermasculinization of amab poc sucks stop that i dont wanna hear about 
				how ur vision of nonbinary existence is actually purely for afab in a way that's obviously transmisogynistic like go shove it. </p>
			<p> <b> nonbinary: </b> Being misgendered feels like nausea, every time, especially from people I know personally. When it's someone who doesn't know any better it doesn't really matter. 
				But if it's my friend, it makes me feel so tired.</p>
			<p> <b> femaleish: </b> People don't think I know how to use power tools or carry heavy things.   I like carrying heavy things! </p>
			<p> <b> male: </b> The only way that I think it has negatively affected me is by the stigma to show emotion as a guy. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> Last summer, I joined a start-up team with two males in my grade. The project started off well, with a lot of enthusiasm, but quickly took a turn. We gave each other tasks to complete then reviewed them together. I noticed when I showed mine, though I thought it was clear I put a lot of work in, comments were either neutral or negative (not constructive). But when they showed theirs, which were clearly done at the last minute, they praised each other highly. Then there were instances where I voiced an idea, it was ignored, then one of the guys voiced it later and the other would tell him it's a great idea. After a couple of weeks, I felt like our work flow was inefficient, so I gave some perspective on how much time or what kind of feedback I needed to do my part. They didn't really listen, which frustrated me because they'd continually ask me to redo things which could have been avoided had they listened to my perspective. Tension built throughout all of these instances. The experience culminated in several absurd conversations over Slack where anything I said was basically ignored or mocked as if I wasn't there. When I voiced my frustration, they shot me down saying I was being "rude". I asked others to read the messages and tell me if I really was, but they said I definitely wasn't. In the end, I finally realized all of this treatment was due to the fact that I was a girl. They clearly weren't accustomed to girls having good ideas, voicing strong opinions, or being assertive in what they need. It was insane because when I reread the messages and imagined if I was a male, I was certain I would have been treated differently. It is unfortunate my gender had to compromise a learning opportunity. It caused me a lot of stress and confusion about my identity. I wasn't sure what I could or couldn't say anymore, since being a strong woman is interpreted as rude, whereas being a strong male is expected.  </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> In high school I was part of a group of friends that was mostly male. I have always been a passionate feminist and very well researched about feminism and women's issues so I would often be vocal to my friends about things they said or did that I was offended by or found problematic. I was immediately labelled the crazy feminist. What's more is that in almost all other aspects of our friendship I could never voice my opinions or experiences without immediately being labelled as crazy, too sensitive, hysterical, etc.  It got to the point where I couldn't be happy in that friend group any more and am no longer friends with those people. I found that because I was female I was always discounted and silenced and not taken seriously. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I feel that my gender has made my professional goal more attainable because I hope to be a midwife and I feel that this field is largely dominated by women in a positive way. In terms of happiness I feel that as an African American woman, happiness is generally not something that is heavily advertised in society however I now have a new determination to achieve it.</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I can't feel safe walking home alone at night or really anywhere once it's even just a little bit dark. All of my other options (ex: taking an Uber) doesn't make me really feel safe either. It's unfair that women have to deal with this constant anxiety even though most assaults are actually planned and are done by someone we know personally. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> My gender identity has made me afraid to attempt things usually characterized as male for fear that I would automatically be bad at them, such as sports or mechanics. This also goes along with the fact that women are allowed to fail far less than men, who are more often than not excused by patriarchal standards. Thus, to fail at something make-dominated would be the ultimate embarrassment.</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I've always looked at having kids as something that I didn't want to do, because I felt that I wanted to put my career first. Knowing that the primary focus is on the mother to take care of the children has always kind of unsettled me. </p>
			<p> <b> female (bisexual): </b> i am afraid for myself and my friends in situations where I should not be. Alone at a club or walking home I feel afraid and in a just world I should be safe. I worry over ever chore I do for my boyfriend, am I becoming a stereotypical housewife? Am I teaching him that women should do these things for men? Or am I just enjoying a few home-cooked meals with him. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> it is more difficult to be a woman in the stem field. although on the surface level it may seem that the opportunities are equal, the biases against women in the workplace and growing up with the narrative that we are intellectually less than, has really caught up to me in my university experience </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> one way that gender identity that has affected your ability to achieve happiness is through my experiences with relationships.  I feel often I worry about how the idea of a women being a 'slut' or a 'prude' causes me anxiety when starting or engaging in relationships </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> My gender identity has not affected my happiness. I am happy because of the person that I am, which may be influenced by my gender identity, but is not defined by it</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> In computer science, my skills and knowledge and my employment feels constantly questioned by others and myself because of my gender. I've gotten so many comments from others saying "You got to where you are because you're a girl and society is taking pity on you" instead of regarding my skills as valid.</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> It has pushed me to work harder and defy gender stereotypes to stand out as an example of a strong empowered successful woman.</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> Seeing most of my role models/most prominent figures in my field be men, it makes things harder because you know you have to be as good if not better to get to that level.  </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> Affected school decisions. I had to choose a school based on support for women, sexism, etc. not just within the school, but the local community as well. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I am constantly aware of my appearance, and the societal value that is placed on me because of what I look like. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I've sought out (and sometimes felt the lack of) female role models in my work and academic life</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> Because women are a minority in STEM, I've always felt that my gender has been the only reason I have been able to acquire prestigious internships. </p>
			<p> <b> male: </b> I have never felt that my gender identity has had any impact on my future prospects or happiness.  </p>
			<p> <b> female cisgender: </b> I experience double standards regarding my behavior compared to that of the men around me</p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> The realities of sexism in a patriarchal society! Yay </p>
