        		<h1>Gender Form Responeses:</h1>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I've been socially trained to achieve my goals by playing into gender stereotypes.  
				I feel too insecure to directly ask for what I want.  
				Instead, I choose to play coy, to make people feel that what I want is what they want, 
				to smile, touch a shoulder, and speak in tones much higher than my actual speaking voice. </p>
			<p> <b> female: </b> I was addicted to rom-coms growing up, and even when I became cognizant of my source of motivation for everything, 
				I still relied on my desire to be the coolest girl-next-door. 
				It's weird to focus on looking apparently feminine but strong. 
				I think a main driving force for me wanting to be an artist was that art would make me endearingly quirky but impressive. 
				Now that I am an artist, I feel I've achieved becoming one, but now I'm not sure what I have to say, why I'm here.  </p>
			<p> <b> male (cisgender): </b> uh i dont really agree with my passing as a cis dude, 
				so in terms of my affect (not my ability to achieve goals, which is kinda helped by passing as a cis dude, 
				(tho impeded by being a poc) people just used they/them pronouns to start with and left it at that unless someone disagreed with neutral gendering. 
				also @yts the hypermasculinization of amab poc sucks stop that i dont wanna hear about 
				how ur vision of nonbinary existence is actually purely for afab in a way that's obviously transmisogynistic like go shove it. </p>
